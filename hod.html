The  prime objective of the Department of Petroleum Engineering, since the  commencement of a Bachelors program of Petroleum Engineering in 1983, has  always been to nurture employable quality engineers. Along with the accredited  program of BE Petroleum, the department also offers Bachelor of Engineering in  Petrochemical Engineering, Master&rsquo;s Program in Petroleum Engineering and  Doctoral Program in Petroleum Engineering and also in Geology affiliated to  Pune University.<br>
<br>
The truly interdisciplinary nature  of this petroleum engineering curriculum demands presence of qualified, experienced  and competent faculty members from diverse disciplines in science and  engineering with an attitude to understand students at personal level and  motivate them to strive for excellence along with conventional teaching. Most  of the faculty members have appropriate professional experience which is  critical in developing students beyond textbooks. The very aspect of personal  relationship beyond classroom teaching by all available faculty members with the  students has helped maintain an emotional bonding between them. The  relationship continues even after completion of graduation and post-graduation  as evident from frequent visits of alumni to department and their availability  for mentoring of students. Constructive  suggestions by the alumni are of great help in bridging the gap between  industry and academia.<br>
<br>
The department has availability of  necessary equipment and software support for the growth of students.  This has helped the faculty members to organize  various students focussed activities as a part of ONGC Chair, Cairn Campus  Connect, and SHELL MOU, Academic collaboration with Aker Solutions, MIT SPE  Student Chapter, SPG Student Chapter and PETROTECH Student Chapter. Support  given by Computer Modelling Group, CMG, Canada, Kappa Engineering, USA, The  Petroleum Experts, USA, Schlumberger India, Midland Valley, USA, and Fekete,  USA by providing academic license of their professional software has helped us  improve quality of training of students in promoting petroleum engineering  education.   <br>
<br>
The <strong>Gold Status</strong> MIT SPE Students Chapter, established in 1989, is one  of the oldest, very active student chapters in India. This platform and the era  of globalization have given students opportunities to participate in ATW as  scribes, conferences to read papers and also to attend paper presentation  contests at national and international level.  Since 2001, nine students have won prizes at  international level and represented at highest level by the award won by Miss  Neeti Joshi, a gold medallist of 2006-2007 batch, at the undergraduate  students&rsquo; category at the Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition (ATCE)  organized by SPE International at California, USA. This tradition has continued  with the winning performance of Miss Rohini Poptani as a leader in IPTC education  week in 2013, runners up performance of Debarprit Chandra at Las Vegas in SEG  2013 and participation as one of the four teams in in the EAGE competition at London  by the group of Ankit Bhowmik, Debarprit Chandra, Himanshu Tyagi and other  three members in June 2013.<br>
<br>
In 2006, SPE honoured Professor L K  Kshirsagar with the prestigious Regional Service Award for Middle East Region  in recognition of his contribution in petroleum engineering education and  motivating students to achieve excellence. He is the only academician in India  to receive this award. <br>
<br>
The MIT SPG Student Chapter has also  received excellent support from the Society of Petroleum Geophysicists, SPG  India who provided students opportunities to participate in different  professional workshops organized as a part of Hyderabad 2012.<br>
<br>
Effective implementation of updated  curriculum, intense co-curricular activities, and emphasis on value based  education by management, excellent bonding of faculty members and students with  continuous encouragement from management and industry have helped department to  gain reputation in India and abroad.  As  a result students are highly competitive, efficient with excellent soft skills and  ready to serve the industry as per their requirement.</p>
